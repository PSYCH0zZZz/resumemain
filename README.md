This repio for my resume. I placed some C programms C03-C13.

C03-C13 derictories with some functions and examples of sorts, trees, list etc.


BSQ - BSQ is a file parser, my program will receive one or more files, which are maps, in these maps, you will have to find the biggest square. We made our best so our BSQ can go as quick as possible.


Also you can check my GitLab repo.
